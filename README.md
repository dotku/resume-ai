A CV (Curriculum Vitae) and a resume are both documents used for job applications, but they have distinct differences in terms of content, length, and purpose.

### Differences between CV and Resume:

1. **Length**:
   - **CV**: Typically longer, often several pages, as it provides a detailed overview of one's entire career.
   - **Resume**: Usually one to two pages long, summarizing relevant skills and experience for a specific job.

2. **Content**:
   - **CV**: Includes a comprehensive list of academic background, work experience, publications, presentations, awards, honors, affiliations, and other achievements. It covers one's entire career.
   - **Resume**: Focuses on skills and experiences that are directly relevant to the job being applied for. It includes sections like summary, work experience, education, skills, and possibly some relevant achievements.

3. **Purpose**:
   - **CV**: Commonly used in academic, education, research, and scientific positions. It is also used for applications for grants, fellowships, and other academic positions.
   - **Resume**: Used for most other job applications in various industries.

4. **Customization**:
   - **CV**: Less likely to be tailored for each position, as it is a comprehensive record of one's professional life.
   - **Resume**: Often customized to match the job description and highlight the most relevant experiences and skills.
